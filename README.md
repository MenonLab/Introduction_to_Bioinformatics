# Introduction_to_Bioinformatics
R markdown files illustrating basic usage and bioinformatics analyses of bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data
These files are part of the 2022 Bioinformatics Mini-Course taught by our lab members (Archana Yadav, Fahad Paryani, Tain Luquez, and Pallavi Gaur), and provide a high-level overview of bioinformatics tools in R for bulk and single-cell RNA-seq analysis. The course is divided into 4 sessions:
1) Introduction to R
2) Bulk RNA-seq analysis
3) Clustering Analysis
4) Single-cell RNA-seq analysis
